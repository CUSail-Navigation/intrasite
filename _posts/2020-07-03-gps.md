Our current GPS is a [Parallax SIM33EAU]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/gps_datasheet.pdf). This module communicates with the microcontroller using UART protocol. It takes about one minute for the GPS to get a _fix_ (a connection to one or more satellites). After getting a fix, it will transmit data about once per second. This data comes in the form of [NMEA sentences](https://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm).

National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) sentences contain information like latitude, longitude, and UTC time. They look something like this: _$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47_. This is an example of a _GGA_ sentence, which contains the current time (12:35:19 UTC in this example), latitude (4807.038 degrees N), longitude (01131.000 degrees E), and some metadata.

There are several different types of NMEA sentences provided by this GPS model, but the only ones that provide data that is useful to us are RMC, GGA, and GLL. See the documentation for more specific details regarding NMEA parsing.
