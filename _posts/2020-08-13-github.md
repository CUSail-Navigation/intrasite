To give new members access to our GitHub repositories, add them as members of the CUSail-Navigation GitHub organization (see below).

![Adding Members]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/github_org.png "Adding Members")

Here, you can also remove people who have left the team and manage who has each level of access to each repository.

To make a new person the owner of the organization (when a new lead is appointed), give then owner permissions. Also, make sure that their email is listed as the _billing email_ under _settings_ (this is just for GitHub's records, they won't actually be charged anything).
