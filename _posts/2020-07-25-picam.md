## Connect and Enable the Camera Module

Our camera is a [Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/). Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi's camera port as shown below.

![Pi Camera Connection]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/connect_camera.gif "Pi Camera Connection")

Now, we have to enable the use of the camera module in the configuration settings. Connect to the Raspberry Pi over ssh, start the VNC server, and open up your VNC viewer. Open the applications menu in the toolbar and go to _Preferences -> Raspberry Pi Configuration_. Under the _Interfaces_ tab, enable _Camera_. You'll have to reboot the Raspberry Pi after this and then reconnect over SSH and VNC.

You can take a picture from the terminal to test the configuration using this command (replace _image_ with whatever name you want):

<pre>
<code class="shell">
raspistill -o Desktop/image.jpg

</code>
</pre>

## Install OpenCV

Currently, the most recent release of OpenCV that will run on a Raspberry Pi is version 3.4.6.27. In the future, it may be worth attempting to reinstall a later version once they become supported. Follow the installation instructions given by piwheels [here](https://www.piwheels.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/) to install dependencies and then OpenCV. To specify that you want a specific version when installing OpenCV, use this notation:

<pre>
<code class="shell">
sudo pip3 install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.6.27

</code>
</pre>

[Here's](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-opencv-capture-video-from-camera/) a python script that you can use to test your installation. Remember to run it using _python3_ instead of _python_. If you run into unresolved dependecies while trying to run the script, try installing these libraries:

<pre>
<code class="shell">
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-103

</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code class="shell">
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

</code>
</pre>
