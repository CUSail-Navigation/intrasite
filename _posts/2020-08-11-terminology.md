## Velocity Made Good (VMG)
<p>
In sailing, velocity made good (VMG) refers to the speed at which the sailboat is moving in a given direction. Commonly, this direction is either directly upwind or downwind. In our implementation, this direction is toward the target waypoint. We define velocity made good as the dot product of the boat's velocity vector, \(\vec{v_b}\) and the unit vector representing the difference between the target position and the boat position, \(\vec{t_0}\).
\[vmg = \vec{v_b} \cdot \vec{t_0} \]
