  <h1 class="section_headline">About the Navigation Team</h1>
  <p>
    The Navigation Subteam works with the boatâ€™s electrical and software components. They work on PCB design, sensor
    integration, sailing algorithms, computer vision, power management, radio communication, and servo motor control.

  <h1 class="section_headline">Competition Events</h1>
  <p>
    CUSail competes in the annual <a href="https://www.sailbot.org/">Sailbot International Robotic Sailing
      Regatta</a>. We generally do not compete in all eight of the events (e.g. the mechanical team does not design
    the boat to be able to compete in payload). Below is a summary of all events; however, full details, including
    scoring, see the <a href="https://www.sailbot.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SailBot-2019-Events.pdf">Sailbot
      Events Page</a>.

  <table id="events_table" style="width:100%; text-align: left;">
    <tr>
      <td class="event_name" style="width:20%">Presentation</td>
      <td>
        Each team will present their project to a panel of experts in the areas of control
        theory, systems engineering, and naval architecture. Twenty minutes are allowed for the presentation and ten
        for Q&A.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="event_name">Fleet Race</td>
      <td>
        The boats will sail between two
        buoys (Start/Finish Line) and then sail around
        two other buoys before returning to the
        Start/Finish Line. Remote control must be used
        for steering. All boats will sail together.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="event_name">Endurance</td>
      <td>
        The boats will sail around 4 buoys
        (passing within 10m inside of buoy is okay) for up
        to 7 hours.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="event_name">Station Keeping</td>
      <td>
        The boat will enter a 40 x 40 m box and
        attempt to stay inside the box for 5 minutes. It must
        then exit within 30 seconds to avoid a penalty.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="event_name">Precision Navigation</td>
      <td>
        The boat will start
        between two buoys and then will
        autonomously sail a course around
        two buoys and then return between
        the two start buoys.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="event_name">Payload</td>
      <td>
        Each boat starts between two
        buoys and will load a (non
        -human) cargo of
        their choice and sail around a buoy and
        return. RC or autonomous control is allowed.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="event_name">Collision Avoidance</td>
      <td>
        The boat will start between two
        buoys and will sail autonomously on a reach
        to another buoy and return. Sometime during
        the trip a manned boat will approach on a
        collision course. RC is not permitted after the
        start.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="event_name">Search</td>
      <td>
        An orange buoy will be placed
        somewhere within 100 m of a reference position.
        The boat must locate, touch, and signal* such
        within 10 minutes of entering the search area. RC is
        not allowed after entering the search area. (*Signal
        means 1) white strobe on boat and/or signal to a
        shore station and 2) either turn into wind or
        assume station-keeping mode.)
